# --- 5. Ethical Reflection ---
print("\n--- 5. Ethical Reflection ---")

print("\n**How might bias in your data affect outcomes?**")
print("""
1.  **Geographical Bias:** If training data disproportionately comes from one region (e.g., highly fertile lands with optimal climate), the model might perform poorly when applied to other regions with different soil types, climates, or farming practices (e.g., arid regions, smallholder farms). This could lead to inaccurate advice or resource allocation, exacerbating existing inequalities.
2.  **Socio-economic Bias:** Data might omit or underrepresent factors like access to irrigation, quality of seeds, financial resources for farmers, or access to agricultural extension services. A model trained without these crucial socio-economic features could unfairly disadvantage small-scale or marginalized farmers whose yields are heavily influenced by these uncaptured variables.
3.  **Crop-Specific Bias:** If the model is trained primarily on data for a few dominant crops, its predictions might be unreliable for other crops vital for local food security or biodiversity.
4.  **Measurement Bias:** Inaccurate or inconsistent data collection methods for rainfall, temperature, or yield reporting could introduce systematic errors, making the model's predictions less reliable for real-world application.
""")

print("\n**How does your solution promote fairness and sustainability?**")
print("""
1.  **Fairness (Improved Resource Allocation):** By providing more accurate and timely yield forecasts, the solution can help policymakers and aid organizations allocate resources (e.g., fertilizers, improved seeds, irrigation support, disaster relief) more equitably and efficiently to areas or farmers most in need, preventing food shortages and stabilizing incomes.
2.  **Fairness (Empowerment):** Access to predictive insights can empower smallholder farmers, allowing them to make more informed decisions about planting, harvesting, and market engagement, reducing their vulnerability to unpredictable conditions.
3.  **Sustainability (Resource Optimization):** Accurate predictions can lead to optimized use of scarce resources like water (through better irrigation scheduling) and reduced overuse of fertilizers/pesticides, minimizing environmental impact (e.g., water pollution, soil degradation). This aligns with SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and SDG 15 (Life on Land).
4.  **Sustainability (Food Waste Reduction):** Better forecasts can help manage supply chains, reducing post-harvest losses and food waste by optimizing storage, transport, and distribution, contributing to responsible consumption and production (SDG 12).
5.  **Sustainability (Climate Resilience):** Understanding how various environmental factors influence yield allows for better adaptation strategies to climate change, ensuring agricultural resilience for future generations (SDG 13: Climate Action).
